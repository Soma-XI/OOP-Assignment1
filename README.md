# OOP-Assignment1

We have implemented a menu with the main class that connects to all other classes. The menu is capable of accepting information toa dd to the system, showing errors with errors messages on the log, and displaying information in the system.

Student class stores all relevant information to Students and their academic career and Person stores all relevant information to the people (like age, address, name, etc.)
